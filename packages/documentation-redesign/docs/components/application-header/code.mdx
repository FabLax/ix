### Development

The application-header can host custom content which will be displayed on the far right side of the header.

### Code

#### Basic

<ApplicationHeaderPlayground />

##### Avatar

Enhance the interactivity of your application-header by placing the avatar component as part of the content. This not only makes the avatar clickable, but also enables the addition of dropdown-item's directly within the avatar component.

## API

<PropsApi />
