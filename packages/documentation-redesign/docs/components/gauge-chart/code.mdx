# Gauge chart

The chart consists of a circular arc with a needle pointing to a specific value, making it easy to quickly assess the status or performance level. Gauge charts are commonly used in dashboards to provide an at-a-glance view of key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Performance metrics gauge
Performance metrics gauge charts, also known as dial or speedometer charts, are an effective way to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics. These charts use a needle or pointer to indicate the current value of a metric within a predefined range, often segmented into different zones (e.g., red for poor performance, green for good performance). This design allows for a quick and intuitive understanding of performance levels.

### Progress circle gauge
Progress circle charts, also known as radial progress charts or circular progress bars, are a visually appealing way to represent data and track progress towards a goal. These charts use a circular shape to display the percentage of completion, making it easy to quickly grasp the status of a project or task. The circle is typically filled in proportion to the progress made, with the center often displaying the percentage value.

### Progress arc gauge
Progress arc charts, also known as semi-circular progress bars, are a dynamic way to visualize data and track progress. Unlike (full) circle charts, progress arc charts use a semi-circle or arc to represent the percentage of completion. This design can be particularly effective in dashboards and user interfaces where space is limited, yet a clear and engaging visual representation is needed.
