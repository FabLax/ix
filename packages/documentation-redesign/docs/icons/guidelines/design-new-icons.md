# Designing new icons

Before you start designing your specific icon set for your application, consider the following:

- Make sure the icons you need are not already in the library

- Maybe the icon already exists under a slightly different name or it might be planned for a future release so please double check or ask us when in doubt

- Consider using more generic icons than creating multiple very specific new ones (e.g.: Use the generic "add" icon instead of creating an "add-wireless-device" icon)

- Do not create alternatives to existing icons just for the sake of your own look

- Ask other designers within your company about the existence of an icon, to prevent creation of duplicates

- Finally: Entrust a professional designer with the task of designing an icon

## Technical requirements

Icons in our design system are monochromatic. They will be colored during runtime, depending on the context they are being used in. For more technical requirements see the "Code" tab above.

## Formal requirements

New icons should follow the app icon guidelines below for a consistent look & feel across applications. For Siemens applications it is mandatory to follow these guidelines.
