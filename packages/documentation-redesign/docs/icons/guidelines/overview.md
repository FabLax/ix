# Icons overview

The following section is about in-app icons, used in the actual application UI and UI elements. It is not about application icons, that usually appear on a launch pad, home screen, desktop, task bar or the like.

## Usage

Icons are graphical representations of terms, functions, objects etc.. Ideally, they are used together with a descriptive text to make it easier for users to learn their meaning. A standalone icon, without textual description, has to be paired with a tooltip that describes the meaning of the icon. Make sure a description can be read out by screen readers.

## Icon library

The Siemens Industrial Experience design system comes with an extensive set of icons made for the industrial context. Since it is almost impossible to cover every thinkable icon usecase, it is also possible to integrate external icons to complement the icon set.
