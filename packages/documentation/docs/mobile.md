# Mobile

There are several different ways to create applications for mobile devices. Native apps are tailored for a particular platform like iOS or Android and usually need to be developed in a specific way for every target platform seperately. Other approaches like hybrid apps are based on web technologies while targeting multiple platforms using a single codebase.

Siemens Industrial Experience can easily be utilized for creating mobile applications jointly with web technology based approaches. With the help of our design system you will be able to swiftly build the user interface of your mobile web app or hybrid app.

Mobile web apps are standard web applications optimized to be used on mobile devices. For this reason, extending an application built with Siemens Industrial Experience or building a mobile web app from scratch to provide an excellent mobile experience is possible without any significant technological changes. Several paradigms and patterns including mobile-first design, responsive design, and adaptive design help developers to implement apps providing a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Disadvantages of mobile web apps include the limited possibilities for distribution (e.g. via app stores), lack of offline capabilities, as well as limited options for the integration of native features like push notifications.

The aspects described above are reasons to consider hybrid applications in order to provide a sublime mobile user experience and also benefit from the advantages of native applications.
Hybrid apps are built using web technologies but run inside a native container providing access to device APIs, allowing native features of the device's operating system and hardware to be used. A variety of frameworks for building hybrid mobile applications are available today. Some provide user interface components for a closer integration with the different operating systems designs. For a more consistent user experience it can be benefitial to favor the Siemens Industrial Experience components over the the frameworks UI components.

To demonstrate the mobile experience with our design system we've build a hybrid example application using Ionic, React and Siemens Industrial Experience:
