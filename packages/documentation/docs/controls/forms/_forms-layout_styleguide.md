Beyond the visual appeal, effective form layouts play a crucial role in usability. In this chapter, we dissect the anatomy of well-structured forms. Explore fieldsets, consider the hierarchy of information, and understand how to strike the right balance between aesthetics and functionality.

## Structuring a form
In this section, we explore effective ways to organize form elements. From fieldsets to section headings, discover techniques for enhancing user comprehension and interaction within your forms.

- **Single-column layout:** Ideal for short forms with a few fields, or small viewports.
- **Multi-column layout:** Suitable for long forms with multiple fields to save vertical space. Use a [layout grid](../layout-grid.md) or flexbox to align fields.
- **Tabbed layout:** Use [tabs](../tabs.md) to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Stepped layout:** Use our workflow pattern to guide users through multi-step forms.
- **Fieldset:** Group related fields together using fieldsets. This helps users understand the context of the information they are providing. Add a legend (title) to describe the group of fields.
- **Section heading:** Use section headings to break up long forms into manageable sections. This helps users focus on one part of the form at a time.
- **Blind:** Use a [blind](../blind.md) to hide optional fields and reveal them when the user selects a specific option.

## Best practices
- **Z and F shape pattern:** Follow the natural reading pattern to guide users through the form (left-to-right languages). Consider a clear order of fields to ensure users donâ€™t forget to fill in fields and improve data quality.
- **Button alignment:** Position primary action buttons (e.g. submit and cancel) consistently, we recommend the following:
	- Bottom left: Short forms (up to 5 fields)
	- Bottom right: Long forms (more than 5 fields)
	- Bottom right and sticky: Long forms that are already filled (e.g. edit) with a large number of fields
%% 	- Top right: ??? %%
- **Label alignment:** By default, the label is positioned above its input field. Use a custom field component for long forms with a lot of fields to position the label on the left which saves vertical space.
- **Grouping fields:** In some cases, it makes sense to combine multiple fields in one [custom field](custom-field.md) with a single label that are connected contextually or through validation e.g. entering the value and unit of an entity, selecting start and end date. It allows a clearer validation, e.g. the end date must be after the start date.
- **Field width:** Use a consistent width for input fields to create a harmonious layout. For example, use a width of 100% for full-width fields and 50% for two-column fields.
