# Pie chart
<!-- introduction start -->
Pie charts are circular graphs divided into slices, where each slice represents a proportion of the whole.
<!-- introduction end -->
This type of chart is particularly useful for displaying categorical data and showing the relative sizes of different categories. By providing a clear and immediate visual comparison, pie charts make it easy to understand the distribution and composition of data at a glance.
## Examples

### Donut chart
Donut charts are a variation of pie charts. They feature a central hole, giving them a distinctive “donut” shape. This design not only makes them visually appealing but also allows for additional information or labels to be placed in the center.
