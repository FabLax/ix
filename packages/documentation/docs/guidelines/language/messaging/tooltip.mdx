# Overview

- Tooltips are concise, short, minimal and used sparingly. 
- Tooltips have a maximum of 2 sentences (sentences are maximum 25 characters). 
- Tooltips use normal sentence punctuation and end with a full stop. Do not use exclamation or bullet points. 
- Tooltips are in active voice: Create KPI tables. / Share with team members. / Activate new zones. Not in passive voice: Tables are created by ... / Projects are shared with team members by... / New zones are actived here. 
- Tooltips start with a verb: Add new users to your project. 
- Tooltips use sentence fragmentation (shortened sentences).  
- Tooltips never use complicated sentence constructions, e.g. no relative clauses.

# Content choices

1. Header with body text (only when emphasizing something)
2. Body text without header (recommended)

## Header

- Use one word headers when possible.
- Use a single noun or verb for headers when possible: Create / Activate / Manage / KPIs

## Dos & Don'ts 

- (Haken) Do use tooltips to give users useful, beneficial and contextual information
- (Fehler) Don't use tooltips to make up for poor UX

## Examples

- Buttons with text cannot have tooltips to clarify what the button does. In this case, rewrite your button text. 
- Tooltips cannot contain the same text as the label, button, icon, etc. There cannot be redundancy in wording. 
- Tooltips cannot contain interactive elements (use pop up / info boxes instead). 
- Tooltips cannot be part of the workflow. 
- Your UX must be able to stand alone without tooltips.
