description: Toast messages provide simple feedback on a process, and as they’re only on screen for a few seconds, they must be easy to read/ written carefully / written with care.
---
Normally appearing for only three to eight seconds, and taking up a very small part of the screen, toast messages need to be short and as specific as possible with very few words. All the guidelines below focus on writing clear, concise toast messages with a simple structure to follow.    

## General rules

- Use key words not full sentences
- Use the same action word/verb from the dialog and button that initiated the toast message
- Use text and icons together to relay your message faster
- Avoid generic toast messages, such as “Successful”, “Unsuccessful” and “Error”
- Avoid using punctuation as this takes up extra space  

## Structure 

- Use no more than two lines, including one title and one text line
- Use no more than 2-3 words for the title
- Use simple past tense verbs in the title, such as offboarded, established, uploaded
- Use the same verb from the dialog and button that initiated the message, such as Upload file → File uploaded
- Give details in the second text line if necessary, such as asset or file name

# Examples

## One-line toast messages

- Dialog/button: Upload file → Toast message: File uploaded
- Start scan → Scan started
- Connect → Connection established
- Offboard asset → Asset offboarded
- Offboard asset → Offboarding failed
- Add asset → Asset added
- Delete → Device deleted 
- Restore connection → Connection restored  
- Maintenance scheduled  
- Cancel scan → Scan cancelled  
- Connection failed
