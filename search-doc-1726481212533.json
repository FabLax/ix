The avatar component offers different options to handle this. Options​ Option\tDescription and usageDefault (1)\tWithout any option set, the visual is just a predefined placeholder graphic. It can be used when identity information is unavailable or cannot be used for other reasons. Initials (2)\tShows a string of one or two characters.

The chatbot has interpreted what the user wants and initially provided what it thinks could be the desired response. The user is then required to keep asking and clarifying so the chatbot finally understands intent and provides the desired solution. In this interaction, the user had to work to establish intent, which leads to a frustrating user experience. When we know our users and their working environment, it’s much easier to train our chatbots to comprehend user intent correctly to them the right response:    Here we see that although the intent for maintenance is very explicit, the chatbot knows to ask which day and which zones as follow-up questions to provide the most precise solution.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Contractions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Language","url":"/docs/conversational-design/language#contractions","content":" We recommend using contractions (connecting words such as it is – it’s) as these sound less formal and more conversational. Unlike in our UX Writing style guide, we recommend using negative contractions such as “can’t” instead of “cannot” as these sound more personable and natural within chatbots.

Using emojis in industrial settings can be seen as minimizing the work and environment of the user. Consequently, we do not recommend using emojis at all for industrial software applications.    Here if the chatbot is assisting with technical troubleshooting in a manufacturing plant, and a worker is reporting an issue with a manufacturing machine, this undermines the seriousness of the situation.    Here the response is more concise, professional and shows the chatbot is aware of the working environment and the seriousness of the situation.

We recommend this approach for desktop-first applications.Adaptive design: There is a separate page layout for a specific breakpoint. We recommend this approach for applications with a strong focus on mobile.  If feasible, we recommend adaptive design since it offers more control over the layout and a more optimized user experience on mobile devices. However, it requires more effort to maintain different layouts. Independently from the design approach, there are different approaches to achieve a mobile-friendly experience:  Adjust the page layout (e.g. a column-based layout transforms into a row-based layout)Restructure the content (e.g. prioritize information or components differently)Hide information or entire components (e.g. less important information or components)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Interaction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"User experience considerations","url":"/docs/mobile/mobile-ux#interaction","content":" Users interact with mobile devices primarily through touch input.

This migration brings several benefits and enhancements to the functionality and performance of our library.  Here are the key advantages of migrating to Shadow DOM components:  Interoperability: Shadow DOM provides encapsulation for components, isolating their styles and markup within a dedicated DOM subtree. This ensures predictable and maintainable styling, while enabling seamless integration of self-contained and reusable components into various projects without conflicts or interference with existing styles and functionality. Improved Performance: Shadow DOM components have better performance due to the browser's optimized rendering of the encapsulated DOM subtree. This results in faster initial rendering and improved overall responsiveness of the components.  Please note that as part of this migration, some changes may be required in your codebase if you were relying on direct manipulation or styling of our components. We recommend reviewing our updated documentation and examples. This can facilitate a smooth transition so that you can take full advantage of the benefits offered by Shadow DOM components.

A variety of frameworks for building hybrid mobile applications are available today. Some provide User Interface components for a closer integration with the different operating systems designs.

To adapt our application to this, we need to set environment variables called safe-area-inset. This helps the ix-application to layout the frame of your application correctly.  --ix-safe-area-inset-top: env(safe-area-inset-top); --ix-safe-area-inset-right: env(safe-area-inset-right); --ix-safe-area-inset-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom); --ix-safe-area-inset-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);   Additionally, some variables specific to your hardware need to be set. In our example, we use an iPhone with a notch at the top. Depending on the display orientation, it's required to adjust the safe-areas of some components (e.g. ix-menu).  body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary'] { /* * If the device is in landscape-primary orientation, * we need to adjust the safe areas for the menu. * The data-screen-orientation attribute is added by the main.ts file */ --ix-application-menu-safe-area-left: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-left); }   The CSS selector body[data-screen-orientation='landscape-primary'] is not provided via the ionic framework. A suitable way to add it to the app is the main.ts file of your project. There are two options:  Capacitor plugin: @capacitor/screen-orientationBrowser api: ScreenOrientation  import { ScreenOrientation } from '@capacitor/screen-orientation'; async function screenOrientation() { const { type } = await ScreenOrientation.orientation(); window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type); ScreenOrientation.addListener('screenOrientationChange', ({ type }) =&gt; { window.document.body.setAttribute('data-screen-orientation', type); }); } screenOrientation(); root.render( &lt;React.StrictMode&gt; &lt;App /&gt; &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt; );   At this point, the application frame should respect all areas of your device which are not part of the app.  Use the defined variables to ensure that the pages of your application displaying content also respect the previously defined areas as well.  .my-content-space { margin-top: var(--ix-safe-area-inset-top); }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Application frame layout​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Mobile experience","url":"/docs/mobile/mobile-app-dev#application-frame-layout","content":" By default, the Application Frame provides three default layouts (sm, md, lg) that are automatically applied depending on the size of the screen.  If you intend to implement an app for both phones and tablets (e.g. iPhone and iPad), it may be necessary to configure the layouts which the application frame can pick from.  For apps targeting phones and tablets, typically the sm and md layouts are suitable.  const Application = () =&gt; { return ( &lt;IonApp&gt; ... &lt;IxApplication breakpoints={breakpoints}&gt;...&lt;/IxApplication&gt; ... &lt;/IonApp&gt; ); };   As mentioned above, in some cases it is beneficial to adapt the layouts (breakpoints) depending on the hardware. For example, the layout md will be applied for an iPhone in landscape orientation and iPad in portrait orientation.  Ionic provides utility functions that help to decide which layout to choose.  const ipad = [`sm`, 'md', 'lg']; const iphone = [`sm`]; let breakpoints = isPlatform('ipad') ? ipad : iphone; const Application = () =&gt; { return ( &lt;IonApp&gt; ... &lt;IxApplication breakpoints={breakpoints}&gt;...&lt;/IxApplication&gt; ... &lt;/IonApp&gt; ); };  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Siemens Industrial Experience Roadmap","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/roadmap","content":"","keywords":"siemens-ix  ix  stenciljs  angular  webcomponent  react  siemens  ix  siemens  industrial  experience  vue","version":"Next"},{"title":"2024 - Q1​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Siemens Industrial Experience Roadmap","url":"/docs/roadmap#2024---q1","content":" Modular application frame: Providing an application frame with modular components so designers and developers have more freedom to fulfil their requirementsFunctional extension of the app header: Extending the current application header with options for use in single and multi-app contexts  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2024 - Q2​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Siemens Industrial Experience Roadmap","url":"/docs/roadmap#2024---q2","content":" Starter project with demo app: Supporting developers with resources to easily get started with our design system  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2024 - Q3​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Siemens Industrial Experience Roadmap","url":"/docs/roadmap#2024---q3","content":" Improved form implementation: Enhancing how forms are implemented and incorporating the latest tech developmentsDocumentation versioning: Providing access to documentation of prior versions  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"2024 - Q4​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Siemens Industrial Experience Roadmap","url":"/docs/roadmap#2024---q4","content":" Enhance UX documentation: Providing UX guidelines for the majority of our componentsCommunity event: Hosting an event to meet our design system users to share the newest developments and listen to your feedback  Disclaimer: The roadmap is subject to changes and errors.
